# Digital Systems Lab(II)
> Update time: 2025-09-14

Learn how to use hardware description languages (HDL) such as VHDL and Verilog to model both combinational circuits and sequential circuits. Gain hands-on experience with Altera FPGA development tools and other computer-aided design (CAD) environments to implement, simulate, and verify digital circuit designs.
